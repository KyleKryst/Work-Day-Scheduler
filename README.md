# Work-Day-Scheduler
## Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler (Module 5 Challenge)

This website was created so that myself, or anyone else for that matter, can add, save and amend input added to seperate hourly time blocks throughout normal business hours for that particular day. 

One only has to click on a seperate time block to then be able to type any notes they need into that hourly time block. This data is saved into the local storage by clicking on the save button, and will still show on the schedule even after the page is refreshed. It is also color coded to be gray for any and all past hours, red for the current hour, and green for any and all future hours. The current day is shown at the top of the page.

## User Story

**SO THAT** I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria 
**GIVEN** I am using a daily planner to create a schedule:

**THEN** I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

**WHEN** I view the timeblocks for that day

**THEN** each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

**WHEN** I click into a timeblock
